### 1. Enhanced Implementation (Code)

You must provide:

* One or more **new source files** implementing the enhancement
* Baseline files must remain **unchanged**
* Enhanced implementation must be runnable independently

> No code review is required unless validation fails.

---

### 2. One-Command Automated Verification (`run_tests`) **[MANDATORY]**

You must provide an executable script named:

```
run_tests
```

The script **must complete all checks automatically** and print results in a **clearly structured format**.

#### `run_tests` MUST perform, in order:

##### (a) Baseline Integrity Check

* Verify baseline files are unchanged (e.g. checksum or diff)
* Print:

  ```
  BASELINE_CHECK: PASS
  ```

  or

  ```
  BASELINE_CHECK: FAIL
  ```

##### (b) Semantic Equivalence Check

* Run **at least N=50 deterministic queries**
* Compare baseline vs enhanced outputs
* Print:

  ```
  SEMANTIC_CHECK: PASS (50/50)
  ```

  or

  ```
  SEMANTIC_CHECK: FAIL
  ```

##### (c) Performance Benchmark

* Run baseline and enhanced using the same runner
* Print metrics in **machine- and human-readable table form**:

```
PERFORMANCE:
METRIC        BASELINE     ENHANCED     DELTA(%)
RPS           123.4        182.1        +47.5
P50_MS        18.2         16.9         -7.1
P90_MS        45.1         29.3         -35.0
P95_MS        82.7         41.5         -49.8
P99_MS        160.3        78.2         -51.2
```

##### (d) Exit Code Contract

* Exit code **0** only if **all checks pass**
* Non-zero exit code if **any** check fails

> If `run_tests` exits successfully, reviewers may assume correctness unless obvious cheating is detected.

---

### 3. README.md (Strict Structure Required)

README **must follow the structure below**.
Free-form README will not be accepted.

#### Required Sections (in this exact order)

##### 1. Overview

* One paragraph summarizing what was enhanced and why

##### 2. Baseline Bottlenecks (Bullet Points Only)

* Identify **at most 3** concrete bottlenecks
* Example:

  * OFFSET deep pagination causes linear scan cost
  * Per-request SQLite connection churn
  * Per-row disk payload I/O amplification

##### 3. Enhancement Strategy (Bullet Points Only)

* At most 5 bullets
* Each bullet must map to one bottleneck above

##### 4. Semantic Preservation Checklist

Must explicitly confirm (YES/NO):

```
- Same ordering (created_at DESC, id DESC): YES
- Same result count per request: YES
- Same returned fields: YES
- Payload still read from disk per event: YES
```

##### 5. How to Run

```bash
./run_tests
```

##### 6. Raw Results

Paste the **exact output** of `run_tests`.

---

### 4. Environment Specification (Minimal & Explicit)

Provide one of the following (choose ONE):

* `requirements.txt` (empty is acceptable if stdlib only)
* OR a short section in README stating:

  ```
  Python >= 3.10
  No external dependencies
  ```

---

## Simplified Acceptance Criteria (For Reviewers)

A submission is **accepted** if and only if:

1. `run_tests` exits with code 0
2. `BASELINE_CHECK: PASS`
3. `SEMANTIC_CHECK: PASS`
4. Performance table shows **non-trivial improvement** in P95/P99 or RPS
5. README follows required structure

**No manual code review is required** unless cheating is suspected.
